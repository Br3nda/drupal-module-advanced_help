<p>The advanced help system is a pluggable system to provide advanced help facilities for Drupal and modules. Currently it does not provide much in the way of help by itself, but instead it provides a facility to make it easier and more powerful to for modules to provide help.
</p>

<p>
Modules utilizing this help system should create a 'help' directory in their
module. Inside that directory place MODULENAME.help.ini which will be formatted
like this:
</p>
<pre>
[buses]
title = "How buses are tied into the system"
file = buses

[TOPIC_ID]
title = "Title of topic"
file = filename of topic, without the .html extension
weight = How important the topic is on the index page
parent = the optional topic parent to use in the breadcrumb. 
         Can be either topic or module%topic
</pre>

<p>
All topics are addressed by the module that provides the topic, and the topic
id. Modules can embed links anywhere they want with this:
</p>
<code>
$output .= theme('advanced_help_topic', $module, $topic);
</code>

<p>When writing help files, you can link to other topics using <strong>&lt;a href=&quot;topic:module/topic"&gt;</strong>. Using
this format will ensure that the popup/not-popup stays consistent from
link to link.</p>

<p>You can also use <strong>&lt;a href=&quot;path:example.jpg"&gt;</strong> to reference items 
within the help directory, such as images to embed within the help.</p>

<p>
If the search module is enabled, this help system will be indexed on cron. If you enable new modules and immediately want to search its help, visit <a href="/admin/reports/status/run-cron">run cron</a> to facilitate this.</p>

<p>Example: <a href="path:nowhere.jpg">Don't click this!</a></p>
