The advanced help configuration file is in simple .ini file format, divided into sections for each help file, plus an optional section for global settings that might be inherited for each help file.

The first line of an advanced help ini file should be ;$Id: ini-file.html,v 1.1 2008/04/28 18:48:07 merlinofchaos Exp $ which will be a comment providing the CVS identifier for the file. The ; indicates a comment character. Anything after the ; will be ignored.

Global settings may be put into a section named <strong>[advanced help settings]</strong> -- this means that this name is reserved and it cannot be a help file in any module. The following settings may be set in this section:
<dl>
<dt><strong>line break</strong></dt>
<dd>If set to any value, the line break filter will be applied to all help files defined by this module, unless that help file specifically is set otherwise. By default, the line break filter is not applied; however, help files can be much easier to write with the line break filter on.</dd>
</dl>

Each section after that will correspond to a single help file, and each one may have the following settings:
<dl>
<dt><strong>title</strong</dt>
<dd>The title of the topic, presented to the user and used in links. If you have special characters in your title, be sure to enclose it in quotes.</dd>
<dt><strong>file</strong</dt>
<dd>The filename, without the .html extension, used for the topic. This is optional; if not specified, the topic name wil be the file name.</dd>
<dt><strong>weight</strong</dt>
<dd>The weight, used for sorting topics on the administration page. Defaults to 0 of unspecified. Items with the same weight are sorted alphabetically.</dd>
<dt><strong>parent</strong</dt>
<dd>The topic ID to use in a hierarchy; children will be listed beneath parents in the topic list, and will have the parent in their breadcrumb trail.</dd>
<dt><strong>line break</strong</dt>
<dd>If set to true, linebreaks will be converted into br and p tags automatically. If unspecified, will default to off. Set to 0 to disable the filter if this has been turned on in the global settings.</dd>
</dl>

For example, here is a version of the <strong>advanced_help.help.ini</strong> file:
<pre>
[using-advanced-help]
title = "Using advanced help"
weight = -10

[translation]
title = Translating advanced help

[ini-file]
title = Help .ini file format
line break = TRUE
</pre>
