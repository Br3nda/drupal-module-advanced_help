<p>To translate advanced help, first create a <b>po/help/$language</b> directory
in the module directory. Then, copy the .ini file and all .html files from
the help directory.</p>

<p>The .ini file only needs to keep the titles; those should be translated. The rest of the data in the .ini file maybe discarded or ignored.</p>

<p>Each file should then be translated in place.</p>
