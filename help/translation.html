<p>To translate advanced help, first create a <b>translations/help/$language</b> directory
in the module directory. Then, copy the .ini file and all .html files from
the help directory.</p>

<p>The .ini file only needs to keep the titles; those should be translated. The rest of the data in the .ini file may be discarded or ignored.</p>

<p>Each file should then be translated in place.</p>

<p>When translating a .html file, you will find that the <b>path</b> keyword will lead to the original directory. If you must translate items that are linked, such as images, use <b>trans_path</b> instead, which will lead to the translated directory. This will allow you to pick and choose which linked items, if any, will be translated.</p>
