Advanced Help
=============

To install, place the entire advanced_help folder into your modules directory.
Place the "advanced-help-popup.tpl.php" and "template.php" files in
your theme's folder. If you already have a "template.php" file, you will need
to append the code in this one to your own.

Go to administer -> site building -> modules and enable the advanced help module.
